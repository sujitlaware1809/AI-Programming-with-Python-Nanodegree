<h1>Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds </h1></div>
<
## Description

- Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs

- Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs





## Principal Objectives

- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
- Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
- Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.
- Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.
